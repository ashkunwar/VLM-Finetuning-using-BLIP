# 🔍 VLM Fine-Tuning Using BLIP

Welcome to this project showcasing **Vision-Language Model (VLM) fine-tuning using BLIP (Bootstrapped Language-Image Pretraining)**. This notebook offers a step-by-step tutorial on how to fine-tune BLIP models for vision-language tasks, empowering you to build intelligent, multimodal systems that understand both text and images.

---

## 📌 Highlights

- ✅ Hands-on fine-tuning of BLIP models on custom data
- 📷 Support for multimodal image-text datasets
- 🧠 Built for experimentation with vision-language tasks (captioning, retrieval, VQA)
- 🔄 Easily extendable for other VLM models or datasets
